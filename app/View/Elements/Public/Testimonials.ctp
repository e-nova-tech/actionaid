      “Every Diwali, my husband Vibhor and i are at a loss of gift options for our friends and family. It used to be very upsetting to know that thousands of rupees would be spent on sweets that would be thrown away or gifts that probably be passed on. So this year we decided to do something different. Something both my husband and I deeply cared about. Children. We decided to sponsor a child for each of our friends. Each child will be sponsored in the name of our friend, who then will hopefully continue to be associated with this program. A tough search through various NGO models, we chanced upon Actionaid India and the wonderful work they do. What we loved was the constant involvement that was encouraged between the donators and the projects they were donating to.  We know for sure this Diwali will be a lot more brighter.  Wishing ActionAid a lot more smiles.”
